This tutorial will demonstrate how to access and work with with multi-dimensional remote sensing data using the python package and open source project `xarray`. This example will use a glacier surface velocity dataset called [ITS_LIVE](https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/).

## Overview

This tutorial contains a number of jupyter notebooks demonstrating various steps of a typical workflow for accessing, processing and analyzing remote sensing data. The structure is as follows:
1) Data access,
    - Accessing ITS_LIVE data stored in s3 buckets on Amazon Web Services (AWS),
2) Manpulation and organization of a larger-than-memory dataset,
2) Processing and analysis at the scale of an individual glacier:
    - a. Clipping large raster to a smaller area of interest and preliminary dataset inspection
    - b. Using xarray for data analysis and visualization
3) Processing and analysis of a group of glaciers within a sub-region using vector data cubes

## Learning objectives
This tutorial demonstrates how to use xarray for scientific investigation of remote sensing data. The learning goals include **high-level science goals** as well as specific *python and xarray techniques*.

* **Load ITS_LIVE data from AWS S3 buckets**
*Lazily load cloud datasets using xarray, dask and zarr*

* **Convert vector polygons to raster**
*Data manipulation with [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/), [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/), [rioxarray](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/stable/), and [Xvec](https://xvec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)*

* **Inspect large, multi-dimensional dataset**
*Use xarray label-based and index-based selection methods*

* **Analyze glacier surface velocity data at multiple spatial scales**
*Use rioxarray's .clip() to subset data to scale of individual glacier*
*Use Xvec, xarray's `.groupby()` and pandas dataframes to compute reductions on groups of glaciers*

* **Examine dense time series of surface velocity data**
*Leverage xarray tools such as `.resample()`, and `.reduce()`*
